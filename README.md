Leno App – Health & Productivity Landing Page

This is a fully responsive landing page for a fictional mobile app called Leno. I built this project using pure HTML, CSS, and a little JavaScript.
The main goal was to practice creating a clean, modern UI and rebuilding a complete multi-section website from scratch.

What I Learned

Structuring larger HTML pages.
Creating responsive layouts with CSS.
Working with flexbox and grid.
Designing sections like hero, features, testimonials, screenshots, and download areas.
